## üñºÔ∏è Note on Image Serving

Please note that if you are using free hosting services for this application, images may not be served correctly from the backend. This can happen due to restrictions on serving static files or due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues. 

For optimal performance and reliable image serving, consider using a dedicated cloud storage solution (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for hosting images, and ensure your backend is configured to serve static files appropriately.
